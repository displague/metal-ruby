  # Note! This call can be used to un-assign an IP assignment or delete an IP reservation. Un-assign an IP address record. Use the assignment UUID you get after attaching the IP. This will remove the relationship between an IP and the device and will make the IP address available to be assigned to another device. Delete and IP reservation. Use the reservation UUID you get after adding the IP to the project. This will permanently delete the IP block reservation from the project.

  # Request more IP space for a project in order to have additional IP addresses to assign to devices.  If the request is within the max quota, an IP reservation will be created.

You can automatically have the request fail with HTTP status 422 instead of triggering the review process by providing the &#x60;fail_on_approval_required&#x60; parameter set to &#x60;true&#x60; in the request.
